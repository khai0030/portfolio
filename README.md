Hello! Here is my Photography Portfolio! I want to share my view and perspective of the world. I was inspired my Marioly's portfolio (mariamarie.com) with her sliding nav bar. I wanted to share my work in a simple but aesthetic way. The different themes i usually picture are Portraits, Jewelry, Nature, Astrophotography, and some other pics of my friends or food etc... I designed my website for 3 devices: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

I learned a lot throughout developing my website. I definitely had to use some websites to find some way or another to make some stuff i didn't know how to do, like my sliding navigation, my drop-down menu, etc... You really can say that, knowledge is accessible with a "click of a mouse"! Some of my pages' layout were really similar, so coding the different pages were definetly easier than usual. What was more challenging though, was trying to get rid of the excess white space that wouldn't go away. But with some time, and a lot of typing and backspacing, I managed to do it.

Here are some resources I used to develop my website
- W3Schools definitely helped through out most of my coding. 
- https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP for my hamburger menu with some editing to match my theme.
- https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-css-dropdown-menus/ for my drop down menu, with editing to match my theme.
- Almost all of the pictures taken are mine, except some pics in "food" and "astrophotography" that were downloaded from https://www.pexels.com/. 
- The Fairy Cottage font and Vintage font were both taken from https://www.dafont.com/.
- the Oswald font was taken from https://fonts.google.com/.
